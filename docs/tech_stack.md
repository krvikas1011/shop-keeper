# Tech Stack

> **Server** : **Spring Boot**, as  we wanted a simple server which mitigates the need of writing boiler plate code. Also, we wanted to chose something where the learning curve is a little less steep and thus we decided to go with this.

>**Database** : **MongoDB**, as we can see that since the shop can have products of all different types and thus no fix schema is needed. And among no-sql databases mongo seems to be an obvious choice.

>**UI** : **React**, as it is one of the most library rich languages and also since we are planning to build an app in future for the same, adapting to react native will be on the similar lines.
